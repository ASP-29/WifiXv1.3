# WifiXv1.3
Source code for my project on youtube named WifiX Project,its just a simple esp8266 pentesting tool including deauther and other
development of the esp8266 evil twin from https://github.com/M1z23R/ESP8266-EvilTwin and the addition of some capabilities taken from the esp8266 deauther function from spacehuhn https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther
some of its capabilities are
1. Deauther attack for the selected target
2. beacon flood to confuse the target
3. Customize the html file that you can upload on the file manager menu
4. Can detect hidden SSID names, useful if you want to attack hidden targets
5. can detect other deauther attacks
